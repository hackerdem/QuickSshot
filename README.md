# QuickSshot
This small application is to get fast screenshots when watching a video or studying a document. With this application, there is no need to take screenshot and paste it to a paint file. When "Print Screen" button clicked, it will be saved as a jpeg file in your C directory in a folder named as Screenshot_Repository.

I will be adding new features to application such gui for start,stop,clear folder and options t oadd it as a system process.
